 * You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
 * Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 * Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
 * n == height.length
 * 2 <= n <= 105
 * 0 <= height[i] <= 104
