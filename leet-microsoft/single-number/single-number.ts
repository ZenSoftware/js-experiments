 * Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
 * You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
 * -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
 * Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
