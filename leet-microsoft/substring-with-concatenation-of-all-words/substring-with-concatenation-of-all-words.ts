 * You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.
 * A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.
 * For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
 * Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
 * 1 <= s.length <= 104
 * 1 <= words.length <= 5000
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
 * s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
