/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/
 * Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
 * A valid BST is defined as follows:
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
 * -231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
