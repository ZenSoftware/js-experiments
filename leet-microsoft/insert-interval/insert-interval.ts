 * You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.
 * Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
 * Return intervals after the insertion.
 * 0 <= intervals.length <= 104
 * intervals[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= starti <= endi <= 105
 * intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
 * newInterval.length == 2
 * 0 <= start <= end <= 105
