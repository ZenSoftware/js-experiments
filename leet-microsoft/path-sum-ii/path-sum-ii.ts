 * Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.
 * A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
