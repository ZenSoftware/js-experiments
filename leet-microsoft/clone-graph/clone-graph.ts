/**
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
 * Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
 * Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 *
 * class Node {
 *     public int val;
 *     public List<Node> neighbors;
 * }
 * Test case format:
 * For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
 * An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
 * The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
 * The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 100
 * Node.val is unique for each node.
 * There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
 * The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
