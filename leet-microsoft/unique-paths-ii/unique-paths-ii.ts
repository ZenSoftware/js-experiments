 * You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 * An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
 * Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
 * The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
 * m == obstacleGrid.length
 * n == obstacleGrid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 100
 * obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
