 * Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.
 * Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
 * 1 <= s.length <= 20
 * 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10
 * s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
 * All the strings of wordDict are unique.
 * Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 10^5.
