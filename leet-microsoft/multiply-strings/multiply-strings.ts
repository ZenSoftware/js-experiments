 * Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
 * Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
 * 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
 * num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
 * Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
