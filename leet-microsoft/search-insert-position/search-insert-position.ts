 * Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 104
 * -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 * nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
 * -104 <= target <= 104
