 * Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.
 * Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
 * Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.
 * -231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1
 * divisor != 0
